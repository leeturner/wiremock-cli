# wiremock-cli

Wiremock CLI is a convenient way to interact with the [Wiremock](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock) admin API

> Note: this software is currently under active development: anything can change at any time, API and UI must be
> considered unstable until we release version 1.0.0. At the moment this has only been tested on a locally running 
> Wiremock server, via http (not https) and with no authentication.

## Docs

For guidance on the functionality provided by Wiremock administration API, please refer to
the [Administration API](https://wiremock.org/docs/standalone/administration/) on the Wiremock website.

## Current status

Wiremock CLI is currently in alpha stage, but still provides a number of useful features.  Full documentation can be
found [here](docs/wm.md).
